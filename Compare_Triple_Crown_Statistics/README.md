# Compare Triple Crown Statistics

This code analyzes Triple-Crown baseball statistics.  For batters, these statistics are Batting Average, Home Runs, and Runs Batted In.  For pitchers, these statistics are Wins, Strikeouts, and Earned Run Average.

The study compares All-Star players against average ballplayers in these statistics.  The study also compares Triple Crown Winners to average ballplayers.  A Triple Crown Award is awarded when one player leads in all three statistics in their league in a single season.

The study compares players from the first All-Star season (1933) through 2016.
