# Bay Area Bike Share Data

This code processes the data from San Francisco's Bike Share program for its first two years (2013-2015).  Find more information about the Bike Share program [here](https://www.fordgobike.com/).

## File Contents

This repository contains the following files:

1. **Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Data.zip**: Contains csv files processed by the Python code
2. **Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file containing the Analysis
3. **Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Analysis.html**: HTML file exported from the Jupyter Notebook file

Download these files and unzip the `Data.zip` file to same directory as the `*.ipynb` and `*.html` files.

## Running code

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file containing Python 3.6 code.

Jupyter Notebook can be installed from [here](http://jupyter.org/).  Alternatively, install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and then launch Notebook from Anaconda.  Install for Python 3.X series.

Open Jupyter Notebook and open **Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb**.

Starting with the first Markdown block, hit `Shift-Enter` for each block to run the code.

After running the code, go to `File -> Download As -> HTML`.  An HTML file will be created like the one in this repository.
