# Stroop Test Statistics

This repository contains one file describing the effect the Stroop Test has on participants.

The Stroop effect demostrates how participants react to interference.  One group of participants is tested twice. The goal is to name the color of the font for a set of words, where each word denotes a color.  For the first test, the word and its color are a match.  In the second test, the word and its color are not matched.
